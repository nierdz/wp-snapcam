WP Snapcam allows your visitors to take a snap using webcam and send it to your WordPress server.

== Description ==

This plugin includes a funky widget you can add to your sidebar to allow your visitors to take a snap using their webcam. It will then displays the last snap or a random one in your widget. WP Snapcam does NOT use a third party service to take snaps, it's all done in JavaScript and HTML5 (with a flash fallback for old browsers) so all snaps are only stored on your server and nowhere else.
You can choose to allow immediatly all snaps to appear on your website or to moderate them before. You can delete, change pseudo, change or remove link from every snap taken.
A shortcode is also available to print the full gallery of snaps. You can then change columns and rows size to make the gallery fit to your theme.

By using WP Snapcam, you'll have all snaps people have taken on your server so you should have a privacy policy specifying all of this according to the law of your country.

WP Snapcam uses [WebcamJS](https://pixlcore.com/read/WebcamJS).
